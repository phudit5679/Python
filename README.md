# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
In this Jupyter notebook, we start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the dataset. After that, we do some pre-data processing to prepare for machine learning. We use 5 types of machine learning models: K-nearest Neighbor, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and SVM to predict bank customer churn.
